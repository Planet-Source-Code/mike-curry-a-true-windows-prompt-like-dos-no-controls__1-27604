### Description

Haven't seen it done yet until I did it myself. I asked around if there was code to create a 'prompt' and all I seen was modifed multi-line boxes. This is not a Dos window, its a windows window. - this is as real as it gets...

If you need a GUI windows command prompt... here it is, Best WINDOWS command line code here...

Please: I am going to use this code for a Business Basic interpreter, if you find any bugs or make it better, please let me know!!! I am always looking for improvement here!! Code is FREE for all...
